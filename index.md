## Welcome!

I am a Swartz fellow at the [Center for Brain Science](https://cbs.fas.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard](https://www.harvard.edu/) working with [Haim Sompolinsky](https://cbs.fas.harvard.edu/community/people/haim-sompolinsky).

During my PhD in computational neuroscience in the [Theoretical Neuroanatomy Group](https://www.fz-juelich.de/inm/inm-6/EN/Forschung/TheoNeuroana/artikel.html?nn=724694) at [INM-6, Research Centre JÃ¼lich](https://www.fz-juelich.de/inm/inm-6/EN/Home/home_node_INM6.html) I worked with [Moritz Helias](https://www.fz-juelich.de/SharedDocs/Personen/INM/INM-6/EN/staff/Helias_Moritz.html) and [Sacha van Albada](https://www.fz-juelich.de/SharedDocs/Personen/INM/INM-6/EN/staff/van_Albada_Sacha.html). My PhD research focused on the link between the single-neuron level and the collective dynamics of neural networks. I approached this problem along different lines of attack: I developed and employed methods from statistical physics to gain analytical insights into the dynamics and I constructed and simulated biologically constrained, large-scale models of cortical networks.

Conceptually, I aim to keep a tight balance between the overwhelming neurobiological complexity and the simplifications that are inherent in modeling. In particular, I try to neither create a "map of the empire that [...] coincides with it point for point" ([Abbott, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627308008921)) nor examine oversimplified systems that neglect all of the relevant complexity. From a broader perspective, I hope to contribute to a shift in Neuroscience from a strongly Galisonian (method driven) culture towards a more Kuhnian (theory driven) approach ([Dyson, 2012](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6113/1426)).
