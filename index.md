## Welcome!

I am a PhD student in computational neuroscience working in the [Theoretical Neuroanatomy Group](https://www.fz-juelich.de/inm/inm-6/EN/Forschung/TheoNeuroana/artikel.html?nn=724694), [INM-6, Research Centre JÃ¼lich](https://www.fz-juelich.de/inm/inm-6/EN/Home/home_node_INM6.html). My research focuses on the link between the single-neuron level and the collective dynamics of neural networks. I approach this problem along different lines of attack: I develop and employ methods from Dynamical Mean-Field Theory to gain analytical insights into the dynamics and I construct and simulate biologically constrained, large-scale models of cortical networks.

Conceptually, I aim to keep a tight balance between the overwhelming neurobiological complexity and the simplifications that are inherent in modeling. In particular, I try to neither create a "map of the empire that [...] coincides with it point for point" ([Abbott, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627308008921)) nor examine oversimplified systems that neglect all of the relevant complexity. From a broader perspective, I hope to contribute to a shift in Neuroscience from a strongly Galisonian (method driven) culture towards a more Kuhnian (theory driven) approach ([Dyson, 2012](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6113/1426)).
