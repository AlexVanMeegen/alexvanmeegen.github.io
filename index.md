## Theory of Neural Networks

I'm a scientist who is fascinated by neural networks---both the biological ones inside our head as well as their artificial counterparts powering AI. These networks work amazingly well (for the most part). However, we still have a rather shallow understanding of the underlying principles. The goal of my research is to address this challenge and to develop a solid theoretical understanding of the principles underlying biological and artificial neural networks. The main tools to achieve this goal are methods from theoretical physics.

#### PostDoc

Currently, I'm a PostDoc at [EPFL Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) in [Wulfram Gerstner's Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lcn/). In extensive collaborations with various of the amazing members of the team, I work on a range of topics from loss landscapes to recurrent networks and self-supervised learning.

Prior, I was a Swartz Fellow at the [Center for Brain Science](https://cbs.fas.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) working with [Haim Sompolinsky](https://cbs.fas.harvard.edu/community/people/haim-sompolinsky). With Haim, I developed a theory of supervised learning deep in the feature learning regime, which enabled a thorough understanding of the learned representations---from the network level down to the level of single neurons.


#### PhD

During my PhD in computational neuroscience in the [Theoretical Neuroanatomy Group](https://www.fz-juelich.de/inm/inm-6/EN/Forschung/TheoNeuroana/artikel.html?nn=724694) at [INM-6, Research Centre JÃ¼lich](https://www.fz-juelich.de/inm/inm-6/EN/Home/home_node_INM6.html), I worked with [Moritz Helias](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/inm/inm-6/forschung/theory-of-multi-scale-neuronal-networks-b-fg-template) and [Sacha van Albada](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/inm/inm-6/forschung/theoretical-neuroanatomy-b-fg-template).

My PhD research focused on the link between the single-neuron level and the collective dynamics of neural networks. I approached this problem along different lines of attack: I developed and employed methods from statistical physics to gain analytical insights into the dynamics and I constructed and simulated biologically constrained, large-scale models of cortical networks. Conceptually, I tried to keep a tight balance between the overwhelming neurobiological complexity and the simplifications that are inherent in modeling. In particular, I tried to neither create a "map of the empire that [...] coincides with it point for point" ([Borges, On Exactitude in Science](https://neilgreenberg.com/ao-quote-borges-on-exactitude-in-science/); see also [Abbott, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627308008921)) nor examine oversimplified systems that neglect all of the relevant complexity.
<!--From a broader perspective, I hope to contribute to a shift in Neuroscience from a strongly Galisonian (method driven) culture towards a more Kuhnian (theory driven) approach ([Dyson, 2012](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6113/1426)).-->
